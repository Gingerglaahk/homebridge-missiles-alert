# Homebridge Missiles Alert

Homebridge plugin for Israeli missile alerts ("צבע אדום" / Red Alert) with HomeKit integration.

This plugin exposes a **HomeKit motion sensor** that turns on when an alert is detected for your configured city, so you can create automations such as turning on lights, sending notifications, or triggering other smart home devices.

Let’s hope you never actually need it.

## Features

- **HomeKit Motion Sensor** - Appears in HomeKit as a motion sensor
- **City-based Filtering** - Triggers only for the city you configure
- **Real-time Monitoring** - Checks for active alerts continuously
- **HomeKit Automations** - Use alerts to trigger scenes and devices
- **Simple Setup** - Lightweight accessory configuration

---

## Installation

### Via Homebridge UI

1. Open the **Homebridge** web UI
2. Go to the **Plugins** tab
3. Search for `homebridge-missiles-alert`
4. Click **Install**
5. Configure the accessory in your `config.json`

### Via npm

```bash
npm install -g homebridge-missiles-alert
```

Or install directly from GitHub:

```bash
sudo npm install -g git+https://github.com/gal-m/homebridge-missiles-alert.git
```

---

## Configuration

Add the accessory to your Homebridge `config.json`:

```json
{
  "accessories": [
    {
      "accessory": "MissilesAlert",
      "name": "Missiles Alert",
      "city": "תל אביב - יפו"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Type | Required | Description |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| `accessory` | string | Yes | Must be `"MissilesAlert"` |
| `name` | string | Yes | Name of the accessory as shown in HomeKit |
| `city` | string | Yes | City name exactly as it appears on the Pikud HaOref / alert source site |

### Important Notes

- The `city` value must match the source city name **exactly**
- City names are typically in **Hebrew**
- If the configured city does not match exactly, alerts may not trigger

---

## Example Use Cases

Once added to HomeKit, the motion sensor can be used in automations such as:

- Turn on all lights when an alert is detected
- Play a siren or spoken warning on a HomePod
- Flash selected lights in the house
- Trigger a safe-room preparation scene
- Send Home notifications to family members

---

## How It Works

The plugin monitors the alert feed and checks whether the configured city appears in an active missile alert.

When a matching alert is detected:

1. The HomeKit motion sensor turns **on**
2. Any HomeKit automations linked to that sensor are triggered
3. When the alert is no longer active, the sensor resets

---

## Troubleshooting

### Motion sensor does not trigger

- Make sure the `city` name is written exactly as expected
- Check the Homebridge logs for plugin errors
- Confirm the plugin is loaded successfully in Homebridge
- Test with a city that frequently appears in alerts to verify configuration

### Homebridge does not load the plugin

- Make sure the plugin was installed globally
- Restart Homebridge after installation
- Verify the accessory name is exactly `"MissilesAlert"`
